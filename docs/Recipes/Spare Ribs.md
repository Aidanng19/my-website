# Wet Seasonings
BBQ Sauce

## Instructions
1. Unpack the ribs on aluminum foil, meat side up.
2. Season the meat side of the rib with the dry seasoning.
3. Flip it over and use a butter knife to remove the membrane and fat.
4. Season the ribs side with the dry seasoning and rotate the ribs to season the sides.
5. Wrap both sides with aluminum foil and let it rest in the fridge for 12-24 hours, ribs up.
6. Preheat the oven to 275F and cook the ribs for 3 hours.
7. Remove the ribs from the oven, remove the top foil and drain the liquid. The ribs should be falling apart at this point.
8. Brush BBQ sauce over the ribs side, then flip it over and brush BBQ sauce over the meat side.
9. Increase the temperature to 400F, then take the ribs out every 10 minutes to reapply BBQ sauce for 50 minutes. This will keep the surface moist and caramelize the BBQ sauce. You can turn off the heat when you feel the surface has caramelized enough and add another layer to cook in the residue heat.
10. Take the meat out and let it rest. Pull the bones out as you cut the meat.
